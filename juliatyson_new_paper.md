The Women Of Melos is a short story included in the writing. He is most known for his writings *Parallel Lives* and the *Moralia*. His essay *On the Excellence of Women* is about brave, courageous, and honorable actions by women. Plutarch dedicates it to his friend Klea.


## The Prologue
In the short essay of The Women of Melos the Melians landed at Caria. Caria was a district of Southwestern Antolia. It is now the southwest of modern Turkey. It is known as the Caria region located in Asia Minor. Ancient Asia Minor is a location region that is located in parts of southwestern Asia including both modern Turkey and the Armenian highland.

The Mediterranean, Black, and Aegean seas boarder Asia Minor. The Mediterranean Sea by the South, The Black Sea by the North, and The Aegean Sea by the West. Caria was a very Hellenized district consisting of mountains in the center and Greek cities along its shore. Hellenized is referring to making Greek. The Carians were united by their religion.

The Melians were from the volcanic island of Melos. Melos was a small Island in the Aegean Sea between the Persian Empire and Greece. Melos is included in the Cyclades, which are a group of islands located southeast from the mainland Greece in the Aegean Sea.

The Melians were specialized in making weapons and also tools. Their creations were found in other islands like Crete and Cyprus and all the way to Egypt This reveals that they thrived in exportation. Melos prospered during the Bronze Age.

It is the island from where the world famous marble statue of Aphrodite originates. Another name for the statue is Venus de Milo or The Aphrodite of Melos which was discovered in 1820. Aphrodite was her Greek name and Venus was her Roman name. The sculptor of the Aphrodite statue is Alexandros of Antioch who lived during the first to second century BC. The statue was created during the Hellenistic age. Aphrodite is the goddess of beauty and love and is a symbol for beauty even when her arms are missing from the statue.

The colony of Greeks from Melos were led by Nymphaeus who was handsome and also their leader. They left Melos in search of a larger country to settle in. Wherever they landed when they were forced to stop sailing is where they were to stay. The Melians sailed until they arrived at Caria.

Their ship was destroyed by a storm and out of pity the Carians gave the Melians a piece of their land. The Melians expanded that land which they were given very quickly. Seeing all that the Melians had made of themselves, the Carians became jealous. They saw how much power the Melians had and became weary and jealous of it.

The Carians decided that they no longer wanted the Melians there and conspired against them. They made a plan to invite the Melians to a banquet and kill them. Caphene, A Carian maiden fell in love with Nymphaeus so when she heard of the scheme, she couldn’t let her love die. Caphene revealed her peoples treachery to Nymphaeus.

When the Carians invited the Melians Nymphaeus told them that it was a custom for them to go to dinner with women. Upon which the Carians gladly told them to bring the women with them. Nymphaeus told the men to come to the banquet unarmed in casual attire while the women should carry a sword in their garments.

They arrived at the feast prepared for the fight. In the middle of the meal the Carians gave their signal to strike. At this time all of the Melian women simultaneously retrieved their swords and handed them to their husband and male relatives.

The Melians surprise attacked the Carians and killed them all. The Melians killed the Carians before the Carians could killed them. This surprise attack was only made possible by Caphene and the women of Melos.

They took over the Carians land making it their own. The Melians built another city and named it New Cryassus. At the end of the story it is revealed that Caphene, the Carian maiden married Nymphaeus.

Caphene was praised for saving the Melians by telling Nymphaeus about the betrayal. The Melians favored Caphene and owed her their gratitude.

## Conclusion
Plutarch goes on to praise the women of Melos for their bravery and loyalty, saying that “it is right and proper to admire both the silence and the courage of the women”(Plutarch VII). He admires how not one single Melian women became timid and turned cowardly. Plutarch was a forward thinker for a writer during his time. He had unpopular opinions and wrote about them even if they would become controversial.
