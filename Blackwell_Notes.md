# Notes

1. Lots of citations!!

Russell, Donald. “Plutarch, of Chaeronea, b. before 50 CE; d. after 120 CE.” *Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Classics*, July 30, 2015. https://doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780199381135.013.5141.

1. Put quotation marks around "The Women of Melos" everywhere.

1. Citation for "Caria" and lots of citations for stuff about Melians.

1. Around line 25… the paragraph with Venus de Milo… think about the sentences and their logical order. Thing "old info -> new info" or "broad -> specific", or "well-known -> surprising".

1. Along the same lines, you might move the paragraph about Caria later: People of Melos; where is Melos; they move to Caria; a bit about Caria; P's story.
